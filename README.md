## Summary

This project includes mulitple APIs including speech recognition, Python text to speech (TTS), webbrowser, pyautogui, os, and most importantly OpenAI. 

## Commands

- To play a song, simply say "play the song [song]." The virtual assistant will automatically open the Spotify Web Player using the webbrowser API and play the song with the mouse using the pyautogui API. 
- To ask for the time, simply include the word "time," in your command. Using the datetime API, the virtual assistant will tell the time.
- To ask for anything else, say the phrase "Using artificial intelligence," at the beginning of the command. This will prompt the OpenAI API to create a response.
